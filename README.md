### Token Engineering 101 (start here)
- [Cryptoeconomics 101](https://aracred.github.io/website/blog/Cryptoeconomics%20101) - 📄 A high level overview to start to orient intuition around the token engineering process.
- [Glossary of systems concepts](https://community.cadcad.org/t/working-glossary-of-systems-concepts/17) - 📄 An overview of the lineage of token engineering. 
- [Token engineering in practice](https://youtu.be/xRqXAlpWl0Y) - 📺 As advertised.
- [Towards a diversity of DAOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75769EjciVk) - 📺 Technologically enabled social systems: DAOs.

### Communities
- [Token Engineering](tokens.engineering) - 🖥️ A community pushing forward the field of token engineering in theory and practice.
- [Commons Stack](https://commonsstack.org/) - 🖥️ A design and engineering group working to create mechanisms and systems that realign incentives around public goods.

### Chats
- [Token Engineering Telegram](https://t.me/TokenEngineering) -  💬 Say hi to the Token Engineering community and talk about all the things.
- [Token Engineering Discord](https://discord.gg/gHvksh8) -  💬 Also a place to say hi to the Token Engineering community, but with more structured channels for various topics related to token engineering.
